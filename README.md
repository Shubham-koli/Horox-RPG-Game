# Horox-RPG-Game
Horox is 3'rd person RPG game. Game contains industry level AAA Graphics. This repository contains code for creating AI and Abilities for the Player Character.

### How to use the code?

first you will have to create blueprint class in unreal engine with the same name that I have given. Then copy the code and paste it in the class! You are all set now.
One more important thing do not forget to create variables. I have included screenshots of the variable which you will need to create.
Each variable screenshot corresponds to that character.

For example variable denoted in the Abilities folder are related to the Player Character.
